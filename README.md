# Greaterthan DevOps handbook

The purpose of this handbook is to document all necessary information to make it possible for everyone with the necessary basic skills to set up, replicate and maintain the infrastructure used for production and test of our software products.

For now this is mostly a notebook used to record information while transitioning from Heroku to AWS.
